# Pathman2

Pathman2 provides a [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html)-style
interface for interacting with files (or file-like objects) wherever they are
stored (local, remote, cloud, etc.). It is a clone of the no-longer-maintainable
[pathman](https://pypi.org/project/pathman/) project.
